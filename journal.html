          <h3>Week 5 Entry</h3>
          <h3>What is the difference between storing data in a JSON file versus browser storage?</h3>
          <p>
            JSON files are stored on the server/file system and persist across different browsers and devices when deployed. Browser storage (like localStorage) is local to the user's specific browser and doesn't transfer between devices. JSON files are better for data that needs to be shared or backed up, while browser storage is ideal for user-specific preferences and temporary data.
          </p>

          <p><strong>How did you use Python to create or update your JSON file?</strong><br>
          I created a Python script that uses the <code>json</code> module to read and write JSON files. The script takes user input through the command line, creates a reflection object with date and content, appends it to the existing JSON array, and saves it back to the file with proper formatting.</p>

          <p><strong>What does your PWA show locally, and what will users see on GitHub? Are they the same? Why or why not?</strong><br>
          Locally, the PWA shows actual reflections from the JSON file that I can update using Python. On GitHub Pages, users will only see the initial JSON file content because GitHub serves static files - the Python script doesn't run on their servers. They're different because GitHub Pages doesn't execute backend code.</p>

          <p><strong>What extra feature did you add to your PWA using the JSON file, and why?</strong><br>
          I added an export button that allows users to download their reflections as a JSON file. This provides data portability - users can backup their reflections, share them with others, or use the data in different applications. It enhances the user experience by giving them control over their data.</p>

          <h3>Week 4 Entry</h3>
          <h3>What Storage, Browser, and third party APIs did you choose, and why?</h3>
          <p id="week4-text">
            I used <code>localStorage</code> to save theme preference and journal entry drafts. For the Browser API, I added a Clipboard API button to copy journal entries. For the Third-Party API, I embedded a YouTube video using the YouTube iframe embed method to showcase a tutorial I found helpful.
          </p>
          <p><strong>How did you integrate each API with DOM manipulation?</strong><br>
          I used <code>localStorage.getItem()</code> and <code>setItem()</code> to persist theme and entry data. The Clipboard API was triggered by a button click using <code>navigator.clipboard.writeText()</code>. The YouTube video was inserted dynamically using <code>innerHTML</code> on a container element.</p>

          <p><strong>What challenges did you encounter, and how did you solve them?</strong><br>
          The biggest challenge was making sure the theme preference persisted across reloads and pages. I solved it by checking localStorage on page load and updating the toggle button label accordingly. I also had to handle clipboard permissions gracefully.</p>

          <p><strong>In what ways do these APIs improve your Learning Journal PWA?</strong><br>
          These APIs make the journal more interactive and user-friendly. Users can copy entries, enjoy consistent theme settings, and view external content like videos — all without leaving the app.</p>

      <!-- Week 3 -->
      <article>
        <button class="collapsible">Hide Entry</button>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
          <h3>Week 3 Entry</h3>
          <p><strong>Which DOM selection methods did you use, and why?</strong><br>
          I used <code>getElementById</code> to target specific elements like the theme toggle and live date, and <code>querySelectorAll</code> to select multiple collapsible buttons and nav links. These methods gave me precise control over the page structure and allowed me to apply interactivity efficiently.</p>

          <p><strong>What was the most challenging part about linking JavaScript with your HTML?</strong><br>
          The trickiest part was replacing the static navigation with a reusable one injected via JavaScript. I had to make sure the active link was highlighted correctly and that the layout didn't break across pages. Debugging the collapsible sections also took time, especially making sure the toggle button updated its label dynamically.</p>

          <p><strong>How did you test and debug your JavaScript code?</strong><br>
          I used <code>console.log()</code> to trace DOM selections and event triggers. I also refreshed each page after changes to confirm the nav injection, dark mode toggle, and collapsible sections worked consistently. Chrome DevTools helped me inspect elements and tweak styles live. Once everything behaved as expected, I committed the updates to GitHub for version control.</p>

          <p><strong>What did you learn?</strong><br>
          I learned how powerful the DOM is for building reusable and interactive components. Injecting navigation, toggling themes, and collapsing content all helped me understand how JavaScript can control both structure and style dynamically. It made my Learning Journal feel like a real app!</p>

          <h3>Week 2 Entry</h3>
          <p><strong>How did you approach mobile-first design?</strong><br>
          I started by designing for small screens first, using flexible layouts and percentages instead of fixed widths. 
          Then I added media queries to adjust the spacing and layout for larger devices.</p>

          <p><strong>Most useful HTML/CSS concept?</strong><br>
          Using Flexbox helped me organize my navigation and page structure easily while keeping it responsive.</p>

          <p><strong>Most challenging part?</strong><br>
          The hardest part was fixing layout issues on mobile view, especially when content or padding caused the page to scroll sideways. 
          I learned how to use <code>overflow-x: hidden</code> and flexible widths to make everything fit properly.</p>

          <h3>Week 1 Entry</h3>
          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>This was my first time building mobile apps, and I learned a lot!</p>
          <p>I made the same Temperature Converter app two different ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>As a Website (PWA):</strong> Works in any browser and can be installed like an app.</li>
            <li><strong>As a Native Android App:</strong> A real app installed from Android Studio.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>GitHub is like a "save button" for code</li>
            <li>VS Code is where I write my website code</li>
            <li>Android Studio is for making Android apps (but it's slow!)</li>
            <li>PythonAnywhere puts my website online for everyone to see</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>The Big Challenge:</strong><br>
          Each tool had its own problems. The website didn't want to install, Android Studio kept crashing, and putting the website online was confusing. But I fixed each problem one by one.</p>
          <p>Now I understand the difference between making a website that acts like an app versus making a real Android app. It was hard work, but I got everything working in the end!</p>
