      <h3>Week 2 Entry</h3>
      <p><strong>How did you approach mobile-first design?</strong><br>
      I started by designing for small screens first, using flexible layouts and percentages instead of fixed widths. 
      Then I added media queries to adjust the spacing and layout for larger devices.</p>

      <p><strong>Most useful HTML/CSS concept?</strong><br>
      Using Flexbox helped me organize my navigation and page structure easily while keeping it responsive.</p>

      <p><strong>Most challenging part?</strong><br>
      The hardest part was fixing layout issues on mobile view, especially when content or padding caused the page to scroll sideways. 
      I learned how to use <code>overflow-x: hidden</code> and flexible widths to make everything fit properly.</p>

      <h3>Week 1 Entry</h3>
      <h3> Reflection </h3>
      <p>This was my first time building mobile apps, and I learned a lot!</p>
      <p>I made the same Temperature Converter app two different ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>As a Website (PWA):</strong> Works in any browser and can be installed like an app.</li>
        <li><strong>As a Native Android App:</strong> A real app installed from Android Studio.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>GitHub is like a "save button" for code</li>
        <li>VS Code is where I write my website code</li>
        <li>Android Studio is for making Android apps (but it's slow!)</li>
        <li>PythonAnywhere puts my website online for everyone to see</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The Big Challenge:</strong><br>
      Each tool had its own problems. The website didn’t want to install, Android Studio kept crashing, and putting the website online was confusing. But I fixed each problem one by one.</p>
      <p>Now I understand the difference between making a website that acts like an app versus making a real Android app. It was hard work, but I got everything working in the end!</p>
